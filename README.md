# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_HR_DATA

I have created a specialised dashboard around the HR data of an organisation, which majorly focused upon the attrition analysis within the organisation. This project has been accomplished as a segment of an internship with the United Network of Professionals (UNP). The HR data that I have dealt with, had multiple aspects that were in relation to the required analysis. It contained essential information like Employee details, the types of department existing within the organisation, utilization of business travel (travel services provided by the company), satisfaction scores given out by the employees in regards to work environment and relationship, employee experience within the organisation, their designations, compensation, benefit schemes and attrition related data. Under the supervision of the UNP professionals, I have managed to create a cohesive attrition analysis around the mentioned aspects. The analysis majorly focused upon key factors influencing the overall attrition rate and suggested actions to control the employee turnover, along with boosting the overall retention of the employees within the organisation. All the necessary data files, along with the dashboard have been uploaded on GitHub for reference and further development.
